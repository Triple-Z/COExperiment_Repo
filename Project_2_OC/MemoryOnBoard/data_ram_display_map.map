      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     16
      Number with same-slice register load:     10
      Number with same-slice carry load:         6
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   279 out of  23,038    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          804
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           435 out of     804   54%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  80 out of     804    9%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         289 out of     804   35%
    Number of unique control sets:              50
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             234 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
